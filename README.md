    "You know that moment when you blow up a few too many barrels and now you can't see anything until next year?
    Or maybe a fire broke out in the middle of your escape route and it just takes too long to wait for it to end?
    Great! Because with this tool you can cut down the size of those blinding flames and get back into combat quicker!
    Just chug it at anything that's currently burning and let the magic happen! Thanks to the short fuze you may even be
    able to extinguish yourself in a pinch...
    It doesn't really have any effect on enemies (except for those pesky skulls), but they don't have to know that, right?
    Enemies will still run away from them. So if you're desperate enough, you can use this to scare enemies and buy
    yourself some extra time!"
